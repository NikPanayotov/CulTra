				<p>Scientists are trying to understand whether humans could communicate using only two colour signals.</p>
				<p>See how well you can understand and use such a language! It may take between 15 and 30 min or even a bit more depending on the learning conditions you get in the game.</p>
				<p>This is not a reflection of your abilities and we are very grateful for your persistence.</p>
				<p>Please try to find a quiet place to avoid distractions during that time.</p>
				<p>Thank you for helping our research!</p>
