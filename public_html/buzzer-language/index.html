				<p>Thanks for considering participation in our language learning game! We are really glad you are here!</p>
				<p>Our research group is trying to understand whether humans can learn a very simple language consisting of only two sounds - a high tone and a low tone.</p>
				<p>Turns out this is not that easy so to better understand why we are trying to track the learning process of many participants. </p>
				<p>To do so, it is really important for us that once you start you continue until you reach the learning goal which will be assigned to you. </p>
				<p>It may take between 15 to 30 min or even a bit more depending on the learning conditions you get in the game.</p>
				<p>This is not a reflection of your abilities and we are very grateful for your persistence.</p>
				<p>You can track your scores throughout the game to see how far you are from reaching your assigned goal.</p>
				<p>Please try to find a quiet place to avoid distractions during the session.</p>
